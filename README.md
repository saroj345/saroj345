> 5 years breaking things professionally so others can't break them maliciously.
> Hardening healthcare infrastructure at Zakipoint Health where a security gap isn't just a business problem, it's a patient safety problem.
> Certified ethical hacker and cloud architect by training. DevSecOps engineer and penetration tester by practice.
> Headed toward **kernel & OS level security** and **critical infrastructure** where the stakes are highest and the attack surface goes all the way down to the metal.
